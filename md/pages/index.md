I\'m a full-stack web developer from Brisbane, Australia who is not too proud to
ask a compiler to help me avoid the stupid mistakes that I regularly
make. While I admit that there is a learning curve, I truly believe that -
once learned - that the static types and higher level abstractions offered by
haskell are just as valuable to the humble web developer as they are to
academics and compiler engineers.

My mission is to convince people of this fact and to help further along
technologies that will make this a reality. There are many things that interest
me, but the four immediate things on my radar for this are
[Snap](http://snapframework.com), 
[Happstack](http://happstack.com),
[Haste](https://github.com/valderman/haste-compiler) &
[GHCjs](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs).

I co-organize the [Brisbane Functional Programming Group](http://www.bfpg.org)
which meets monthly with talks about functional programming and eat lots of
pizza. If you\'re in Brisbane and have the 4th of the month free, please drop by
and say hi.

Outside of the technical side of things, I\'m also a
[Crossfitter](http://crossfitbrisbane.com),
[Yogi](http://cultivatecalmyoga.vpweb.com.au/) and a terrible Skateboarder. I
also [take far too many pictures of my dog](http://instagram.com/benkolera). ;)
